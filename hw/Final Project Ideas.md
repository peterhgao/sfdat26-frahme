Q1:  What characteristics influence engagement for our Twitter posts? i.e day/time/topic/hastag

I have some data in a shared file, I can also pull our data through our API


Q2:  Twitter/Facebook sentiment analyzer

Be able to reply to negative comments faster


Q3:  Identify generic drugs that have the potential to increase in price.  Scan the FDA and other large manufactuer websites for info on new approvals, recalls, etc

This is more of a fun idea in response to the Epi Pen price increase fiaso
